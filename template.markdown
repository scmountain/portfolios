Cohort norms


What actions do you want to take for yourself and your cohort to be successful at Turing?
I will fully commit to being a student and work as hard as humanly possible to become an exceptional developer. In addition, I will further contribute to the Turing community, hopefully in such a way that I can become a prominent figure within the community. 

How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?
Given that I am rather high on the extroversion spectrum, I know that one of my key strengths moving forward will be my ability to effectively communicate with others. In addition, given that I tend to have a more outgoing nature, I will likely take on the leadership role in many situations, which can be a very powerful position if capitalized upon in a transformational manner. 

How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
To others who are either lower on the extrovert scale or tend more towards introversion, I can be perceived as a bit loud and sometimes annoying. However, by acknowledging that there are different personality types in the world, I am able to dial back the intensity of my extroversion when necessary. 

How to work with an extrovert? 
Extroverts enjoy communicating with others and creating new relationships. To best get along with an extrovert, converse over an interesting, attention-grabbing topic and be patient with them, as sometimes they will possess a great amount of energy when the time is not right. 


Growth Mindset


What are your triggers, what's likely to move you to fixed mindset? 
 
Raised in a family of all athletes, competition has been my life as long as I have known it. Therefore, I have noticed that my competitive spirit can sometimes get the better of me. However, in an environment such as Turing, I have been able to utilize this mindset in a healthy way by competing with my most recent personal best during every new project. 

What can your peers do to support your growth mindset?

Let's make this a team effort, of Turing vs the “other schools/ job markets,” how can you support each other in creating a cohort culture that supports growth mindset?
If you have nothing nice to say, keep it to yourself
 
Personal Narrative


What brought you here?
I chose to pursue coding at Turing as the knowledge that I will gain here provides me with a foundation which I can utilize in a technologically driven world. As the global interconnectivity continues to increase, I believe that the skillset that I gain here, at Turing, will allow me to travel the world while working.


What are the values that drive you?
Honesty, empathy, and the determination to get the job done the right way the first time. 

How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you? 
I try to embody these characteristics in every facet of my life, whether it be in my personal relationships or professional relationships. I stand firmly by the ideology “actions speak louder than words,” and I try to exhibit these traits in my life on a daily basis through every action that I take. 

How do you think these differences/similarities will impact your cohort?
As we enter into higher modules, I am sure that the learning curve will only grow steeper and the grind will grow tougher. However, between my extroverted nature and my enduring determination, I intend to serve my cohorts as a leader, bringing through the tough times that lie ahead. In addition, I intend to be a loyal and honest friend that fellow cohort members enjoy being around, while contributing to the knowledge pool.
